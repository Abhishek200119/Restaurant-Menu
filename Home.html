    with navigating Bangalore traffic and we know it would take a little longer to complete our restaurant, resto-pub
    wishlist. To make matters easier for you, here are the 5 newest restaurants in Bangalore that you have to check out

    flavours like falooda and tender coconut water. Gorge on wholesome biryani, succulent kebabs and even crispy kale
